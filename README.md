# Predicting Mobile Device Prices with Linear Regression

In this project, I followed a structured approach to data analysis and model building. Here are the key steps and highlights of the project:

1. **Data Loading:** I started by importing the necessary libraries, including Pandas for data manipulation. I loaded a dataset containing mobile device information, including features such as user ratings, RAM, storage, camera specifications, and battery capacity.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** I performed data preprocessing tasks like removing unnecessary columns, ensuring data quality, and separating the target variable (mobile device prices) and the independent features.

3. **Train-Test Split:** To assess the model's performance, I split the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing) using scikit-learn's `train_test_split` function.

4. **Linear Regression Model:** I used scikit-learn's Linear Regression algorithm to train a predictive model using the training data. The model learned the relationship between the mobile device features and their prices.

5. **Model Evaluation:** I tested the model's performance by making predictions on the test data and calculating the R-squared (R2) score, which measures how well the model explains the variance in the prices.

6. **Prediction:** I also provided a feature for users to input specific mobile device features, and the model would predict the price based on these inputs. This feature can be used for price estimation.
